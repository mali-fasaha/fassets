/**
 * This interface represents a way for sending messages in the application. <br> Please note it is expected that the queue is expected to operate through use of database persisted strings <br> The
 * class primarily uses the push method to add a typed message. For instance, for the below implementation : <br> {@code public void push(QueueMessage<FileUpload> queueMessage) } <br> A client could
 * add a file upload message as shown:
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *     QueueMessage<FileUpload> fileUploadsQueue = new FileUploadsQueue(fileUploadService);
 *      fileUploadsQueue.push(() -> new FileUploadNotification(fileUpload.getFileName());
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <br>Should the client need to carry out an action to show completion lifecycle method, the client could call the
 * {@link io.github.fasset.fasset.kernel.util.queue.util.OnCompletion#handleCompletion()} method as shown: <br>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 *     fileUploadsQueue.push(() -> new FileUploadNotification(fileUpload.getFileName()),
 *      () -> log.debug("The file {} has been uploaded", fileUpload.getFileName()));
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * TODO : implement consumers for this Queue
