 * This is a thin wrapper for data to be passed around the {@link Subscriber} implementations
 * The object being transported can be loaded through lambda semantics, then unloaded
 * by the {@link Subscriber} using {@code getPayload()} method.
 * Rather than use generics which would lead to unnecessary complications, the "unloaded" value
 * will need to be casted into their respective types. This approach of "dumb update - smart subscriber"
 * assumes the {@link Subscriber} will take care while unloading the update, and also enables the
 * {@link SubscriptionService} to quickly upload any type of data through.
 * {@link Subscriber} be aware...
