/**
 * This is a functional interface allowing producers an option to handle an error as they deem fit. <br> The {@code FileSystemStorageService} stores a file into the system using the {@code
 * FileSystemStorageService#store(file)} method. The file having been stored in the file system the service then calls the
 * {@link io.github.fasset.fasset.kernel.util.queue.MessageQueue#push(QueueMessage, * OnError, OnCompletion)} method to notify the system of this event for future detached asynchronous processing.
 * <br> however an error occurs during the enqueuing process this despite the fact the
 * file has already been uploaded to the file system <br> To handle this anomaly the Service will try to call the {@code FileSystemStorageService#store(file)} method in the following fashion: (take
 * note of the second parameter of the push method) <br> <br>
 * <pre>
 *  {@code fileUploadsQueue.push(() -> new FileUploadNotification(fileUpload.getFileName()), () -> {
 *                 store(file);
 *             }, () -> {
 *                 fileUpload.setTimeUploaded(LocalDateTime.now());
 *                 log.debug("The file {} has been uploaded", fileUpload.getFileName());
