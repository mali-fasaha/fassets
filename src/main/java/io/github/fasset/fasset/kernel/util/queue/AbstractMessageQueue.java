/**
 * This class provides a common framework for how the completion and handle error methods should be seen. <br> The client being a MessageQueue 'producer' needs not bother with who to 'arrange'
 * handling errors and handling completion. It only needs to provide an implementation of the {@link MessageQueue#push(QueueMessage)} method. <br> This example shows how the {@code FileUploadsQueue}
 * 'producers' has implemented the {@link MessageQueue} interface by implementing the {@link MessageQueue#push(QueueMessage)} method. The {@link MessageQueue#push(QueueMessage, OnError)} method and
 * the {@link MessageQueue#push(QueueMessage, OnError, OnCompletion)} method become available to the {@code FileUploadQueue} simply by extending this class. Should the client desire a different
 * approach for the lifecycle methods, nothing's wrong with it skipping this class and implementing the whole interface by itself. <br>
 * <br> <pre>
 *     {@code
 *     @Override
 *     public void push(QueueMessage<FileUpload> queueMessage) {
 * <p>
 *         fileUploadService.recordFileUpload(queueMessage.message());
 *     }
 *     }
 *    </pre>
 * <p>
 * <br> Note: <br> The client above simply implements the queue method push by recording the message to the {@code FileUploadService}
