/**
 * <br>Account naming policy is dirt simple. The account is simply the name of the category. There are however embedded hierarchies which are partitioned by variables like, service outlet, currency
 * account type and so on and so forth. <br> This class provides common understanding for instance on implementation and meaning of currency code inclusion into the account number id sequence. That
 * does not need to go into so many types of implementation. <br> It also provides a way to block methods not needed in the subclass, for instance we do not need a contra-account for credit account,
 * so we simply implement it here and throw an unsupported operation exception
