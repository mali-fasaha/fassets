/**

 * one can expect that all acquisition transaction would be posted to the Sundry Creditor's account abstracting this application
 * from the knowledge of to which stakeholders settlements as this varies to a large degree depending on the domain of a given
 * tax authority, the same amount being split between vendor and tax authority in varying ratios. This is complicated situation to
 * master that requires more than one account, the effect of which could hardly be justified by the effort.
