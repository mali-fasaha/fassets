/**
 * Implements the {@code AccountIdService} using pre stated values in a properties which are managed in
 * an internal map
 * <br> This implementation provides identities for accounts various types of transactions, for instance:
 * <br> i. acquisition transactions,
 * <br>in this transaction it is expected that the debit account would be the asset account tracking its category,
 * and the credit account would be the sundry creditor's account. This being because tracking who exactly is paid
 * for this asset is beyond the scope of this application.
 * <br> One peculiar aspect of this implementation is that pre-configured properties are read from a properties
 * file. This is peculiar because this implementation will have siblings in future that could be reading configuration
 * properties from a json api over http, from a database which is configured at runtime or even from an excel file.
