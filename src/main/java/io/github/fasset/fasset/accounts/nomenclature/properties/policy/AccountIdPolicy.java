/**
 * This interface acts as building blocks to how assets are identified in front-facing systems using simple structure
 * which is data that has to be extracted from the asset attributes themselves.
 * <br> For instance instead of inquiring the currency code to be given to an account number to track a given asset, instead
 * we are asking what currency code will be given to an account number that identifies an account of an asset whose monetary
 * attributes are denominated in currency whose ISO 4217 code is 'KES' or 'USD'.
 * <br> This means that this interface can be reused for other things and not necessarily assets, since the queries are less abstract
 * <br> Also this means that the accountIdPolicy which should exist in the business domain and currently only exists in my
 * mind as the developer can be changed changed from a single point being an implementation of this policy.
 * <br> The current implementation will be known as {@code AccountIdPolicyVersion1}. Upon emergence of more light this might
 * be scrapped and be implemented as {@code AccountIdPolicyVersion2}. The 'scrapping' is a matter of changing default implementation
 * in the dependency container.
 * <br> One thing is not likely to change though. The fact that most things are assessed, depreciated, analysed, classified from
 * the asset category perspective. Depreciation, reporting, verification, revaluation and maintenance policies are bound to
 * be formulated and implemented with regards to an assets category.
 * <br> Even as a developer well rehearsed with the problem space I do have or think to have attained all the light to clearly
 * perceive the problem space and its attributes, but what I do think is that the business domain can be for the yet unforeseeable
 * future, be bent to appreciate assets from the category perspective. Bigger companies would not lack the service-outlet guys,
 * the currency guy, year of manufacture and year of acquisition guys. But that would be beyond the reach of this application.
 * Such guys should see me on the side and we can talk about how much value we need to give to my time, because such flexibility
 * would require time to implement. Or we can still try and do in this rapid development cycle, without shooting our hypothetical foot
 * and yet this is without guarantees of actually not blowing the whole damn foot in the process. One such scenario would be in
 * a distributed environment ... oh! Here's another one, micro-services architecture. If you would think to implement mutating
 * configurations in these two you are destined to experience pain the heights of which you have not experienced before.
