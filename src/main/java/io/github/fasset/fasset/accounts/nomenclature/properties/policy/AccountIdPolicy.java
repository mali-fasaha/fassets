/**
 * This interface acts as building blocks to how assets are identified in front-facing systems using simple structure which is data that has to be extracted from the asset attributes themselves. <br>
 * For instance instead of inquiring the currency code to be given to an account number to track a given asset, instead we are asking what currency code will be given to an account number that
 * identifies an account of an asset whose monetary attributes are denominated in currency whose ISO 4217 code is 'KES' or 'USD'. <br> This means that this interface can be reused for other things and
 * not necessarily assets, since the queries are less abstract <br> Also this means that the accountIdPolicy which should exist in the business domain and currently only exists in my mind as the
 * developer can be changed changed from a single point being an implementation of this policy. <br> The current implementation will be known as {@code AccountIdPolicyVersion1}. Upon emergence of more
 * light this might be scrapped and be implemented as {@code AccountIdPolicyVersion2}. The 'scrapping' is a matter of changing default implementation in the dependency container. <br> One thing is not
 * likely to change though. The fact that most things are assessed, depreciated, analysed, classified from the asset category perspective. Depreciation, reporting, verification, revaluation and
 * maintenance policies are bound to be formulated and implemented with regards to an assets category. <br> Even as a developer well rehearsed with the problem space I do have or think to have
 * attained all the light to clearly perceive the problem space and its attributes, but what I do think is that the business domain can be for the yet unforeseeable future, be bent to appreciate
 * assets from the category perspective. Bigger companies would not lack the service-outlet guys, the currency guy, year of manufacture and year of acquisition guys. But that would be beyond the reach
 * of this application. Such guys should see me on the side and we can talk about how much value we need to give to my time, because such flexibility would require time to implement. Or we can still
 * try and do in this rapid development cycle, without shooting our hypothetical foot and yet this is without guarantees of actually not blowing the whole damn foot in the process. One such scenario
 * would be in a distributed environment ... oh! Here's another one, micro-services architecture. If you would think to implement mutating configurations in these two you are destined to experience
 * pain the heights of which you have not experienced before.
